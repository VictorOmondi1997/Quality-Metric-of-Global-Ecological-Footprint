Unlike regression, the target variable in a classification problem is discrete. Each data point used in training classification models must have a corresponding label in order for the characteristics and patterns in the classes to be learnt appropriately.

    "Every year people demand more from nature than it can regenerate. Individuals, communities and government leaders use ecological footprint data to better manage limited resources, reduce economic risk, and improve well-being. The Dataset provides Ecological Footprint per capita data for years 1961-2016 in global hectares (gha). Ecological Footprint is a measure of how much area of biologically productive land and water an individual, population, or activity requires to produce all the resources it consumes and to absorb the waste it generates, using prevailing technology and resource management practices. The Ecological Footprint is measured in global hectares. Since trade is global, an individual or country's Footprint tracks area from all over the world. "

It is a discriminative classifier that estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a class using an s-shape function curve called the sigmoid function. The predicted values obtained after using a linear equation on the predictors by applying logistic regression can fall in the range of negative infinity to positive infinity. The sigmoid maps these results by shrinking the value to fall between 0 and 1.  We can say that we use the sigmoid function to transform linear regression into logistic regression."

Although there are different techniques used in performing cross validation, the fundamental concept involves partitioning the dataset into a number of subsets, holding out a set for evaluation then training the model on the other sets. This gives a more reliable estimate of how the model performs across different training sets because it provides an average score across different training samples used. The only drawback with cross validation is that it takes more time and computational resources however, the gain obtained in having a better model is very well worth this cost. **K-Fold cross validation**, **Stratified K-Fold cross validation** and **Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)** are some cross validation techniques.\n",

This means that an increase in the probability of a class causes a decrease in the probability of at least one of the other classes. It can also be referred to as a generalization of logistic regression or the sigmoid function and can be used for multi-class classification while the sigmoid function is used in multi-label classification. The softmax function is popularly used in the output layers of neural networks. Although the sum of the outputs of the softmax must be 1, this is not the same for the sigmoid function. "

    "The recursive partitioning of nodes until the final subsets are obtained in decision trees makes it prone to overfitting. The deeper the tree, the higher the chances of the overfitting. This can be prevented using a stopping criterion such as early stopping and pruning. Early stopping or pre-pruning involves stopping the tree-building process before the tree becomes too complex and the training data is perfectly classified. An early stopping condition like the maximum depth can be set to avoid deep trees such that the tree stops growing after reaching the set maximum depth for the tree. Another early stopping criterion that can be used is the classification error. At every splitting stage, the error is checked. If there is no significant decrease in the error, there is no need to make the tree more complex. When there are fewer data points than a set threshold value, early stopping can also take place. Early stopping may also produce underfit models if it stops too early. Post-pruning, on the other hand, allows the tree to be fully built before simplifying by removing sections of the tree at different levels by calculating the error rate."
